# This is my version of my school website

When i made this i was pretty much a noob and learnt my way through the whole process of making this. I had so much fun while making this and i learnt a lot. 
This is just my version of my school website and nothing else, my school website is much much better but i just wanted to keep myself to praciting HTML & CSS so i took this as a challenge to keep the amount of patience i have and the creative skills i have. This was a great challenge for me, even if there isn't very many things in this website, it took a lot of time to make as it is my first website.
Through the whole process the most painful part was when i had to sit for hours typing and trying to figure out a way to do something that i want to but not getting it even after hours of trying.
I do have patience but this was the one which broke it, i got angry and it was very frustrating to make this but by the end i learnts rage and anger won't do anything and i got more patience with this experience to make a website. 

It took me ~5-7 days, working for ~ 5-6 hours daily.

I would really love to listen any suggestions on this ðŸ™‚.
